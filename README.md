# Robust Fat Fraction Mapping with Phase-Cycled bSSFP

## Overview
This repository contains the code accompanying the publication:

**"Robust fat fraction mapping in the presence of magnetic field inhomogeneities with phase-cycled bSSFP"**  
by **Berk Can Acikgoz**  

This code provides implementations for fat fraction (FF) mapping using phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) while addressing magnetic field inhomogeneities. It includes functions for data processing, reconstruction, and analysis.
